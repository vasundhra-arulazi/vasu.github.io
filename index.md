Hi! My name is Vasundhra Arulazi, and I am a senior at [Lawrence E. Elkins](https://www.fortbendisd.com/ehs) High School in Texas (Class of 2025). I plan to major in Aerospace Engineering.

Outside of my school, I have a strong interest in photography, particularly astrophotography and art. During the weekends, I volunteer at the East Dome in George Observatory in operating the telescope for public viewing. I also represent Fort Bend Astronomy Club in outreach events. I am one of the founders of Astronomy Club at Elkins High School. I am also an animal lover and enjoy spending time with my furry friends. You can read more about my publications in the [publications](https://vasundhra-arulazi.github.io/publications/) tab.

You can find some adorable pictures of my dog in the [dog pics](https://vasundhra-arulazi.github.io/dog/) section.
