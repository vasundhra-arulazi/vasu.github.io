Hi! My name is Vasundhra Arulazi, and I am a junior at [Lawrence E. Elkins](https://www.fortbendisd.com/ehs) High School in Texas.

Outside of my school, I enjoy photography (astro!!!), art, and animals. Check out the [dog pics](https://vasundhra-arulazi.github.io/dog/) section for pictures of my dog!
