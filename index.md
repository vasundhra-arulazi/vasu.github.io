Hi! My name is Vasundhra Arulazi, and I am a junior at [Lawrence E. Elkins](https://www.fortbendisd.com/ehs) High School in Texas. My goal is to become an Aerospace engineer in the future.

Outside of my school, I have a keen interest in photography, particularly astrophotography, and art. I am also an animal lover and enjoy spending time with my furry friends. You can find some adorable pictures of my dog in the [dog pics](https://vasundhra-arulazi.github.io/dog/) section.
